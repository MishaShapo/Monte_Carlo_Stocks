# Monte_Carlo_Stocks
An IPython notebook demonstrating Monte Carlo simulations of stock prices

This is a project I created to learn more about Python and Monte Carlo simulations.
It turns out both are pretty useful for putting something together very quickly
and for using probability to make educated financial decisions.
